# Laboratorio2
This is a chat room made with HTTP protocol in python for a lab 2 in the course of networking 2

You have to install python to run this program

First, You have to run the file called "server.py" to generate a server where the clients can connect to it. Later, you run the "client.py" in one port like 54000
and the client2.py in a port like 53000 to evade error in localhost. Finally, you write the name of the person in the chat room, and start to send text to the chat room.
Now, you have to press "enter" if you want to see the messages preview because it works in console so there is a problem with the "input()" function in Python.
